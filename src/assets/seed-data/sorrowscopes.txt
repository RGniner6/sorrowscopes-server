Leo: Mermaids were actually manatees that drunken sailors mistook for beautiful creatures, just like you with your ex.

Libra: You will become one with nature this week when your atoms are dispersed into a fine spray.

Virgo: People aren't texting you back because you're annoying, not because they’re busy.

Scorpio: Feel free to go for a walk today and just enjoy nature. Do not take a constitutional or even a leisurely stroll, it MUST be a WALK.

Scorpio: You will be visited by The Screaming Man. He mostly screams positive things, but your neighbors will still complain.
Sagittarius: If you hold a seashell to your ear you can hear the sea, and if you hold a snail shell to your ear you can hear the snails, but they will be able to hear you too.

Capricorn: Don’t open any new doors today. Seriously...only use doors you’ve seen before we’re not kidding.

Virgo: You will be late to work tomorrow when a flock of starlings clutch at you with their scaly claws and release you several blocks away. Plan accordingly.

Scorpio: With hard work and dedication you too can be found mummified in the woods.
Sagittarius: You're a terrible lover and not much of a fighter. Do you dance?
Capricorn: You’ll wake to find a zipper on your back. Do not open it.

Pisces: I know things seem bad for you right now, but here’s the thing: they are. And they always will be.
Aries: Birds need gravity to swallow. You know what they don’t need? Your shit.
Virgo: With Mercury in retrograde your biggest decisions depend on figuring out who around you is human, and who simply wears a human's face.
Taurus: The Universe is vast and ever-expanding but sure, you'll find your soulmate in the infinitesimal geographical limits of your own daily life, why not.
Gemini: Find beauty in the little things today. A flower. A baby’s smile. The suffering of your enemies.
Cancer: Look for friends in unexpected places. I mean, you haven't had any luck looking in the expected places so you might as well, right?
Leo: You think you’ve made a new friend but it’s actually the infinite abyss of your own restless soul, staring back at you from a cursed mirror.
Libra: A mild argument with your oldest, dearest friend may stir up outrage in you today. Be sure to indulge it by ignoring their apology and cutting them and their toxicity out of your life forever.
Scorpio: If they stitched half your body to half the body of another person, would you be two people or the same person? The "they" in this scenario is Chick-fil-A, if that matters.
Sagittarius: You’re lucky in love this month, with a secret admirer confessing their love for you. At least, I’m assuming that’s what that means when you find a sheep heart nailed to your front door.
Capricorn: Save yourself unnecessary stress this week by breaking down unanswerable questions into affirmations of truth. For instance, "Why is life an unrelenting downward spiral of chaos and misery?" becomes simply "Life is an unrelenting downward spiral of chaos and misery.”

Sagittarius: You'll survive the robot revolution and live a long life when it turns out even robots find the dumb noise you make when hurt hilarious.

Capricorn: The sun shines only for you today but beware: at dusk the moon will cry, “What was all that about?”

Taurus: Have you tried turning your life off and on again?
Gemini: Due to a series of unfortunate events, your life will remain exactly the same.
Cancer: You will find yourself remembering haunting details about your ex. Their smile. Their scent. The way they broke your fucking heart.
Leo: You don't need any help from us with fucking up your life.
Virgo: Expect romance on the horizon. Do not expect it to ever come closer to you than that.
Libra: A surprise awaits. It will be underwhelming, much like your life.
Scorpio: Laws are just things that exist in your mind to keep you from being happy.
Sagittarius: They say revenge is a dish best served cold which explains the bowl of poisoned gazpacho your ex will leave on your doorstep.

Virgo: You will finally become the thing you hate the most this week: yourself.
Libra: You realize that your recurring childhood nightmare about being utterly alone in a world filled with demons was actually just a premonition about what it’s like to look for a job as an adult.
Scorpio: Damn... the Stars are just going to fuck you all the way up.
Sagittarius: You'll find either love or wealth this week, but not both. So choose wisely you poor, lonely bastard.

Aquarius: The Quaker Oatmeal man will free himself from the surface of the container and beat you for not being Christian.
Pisces: It’s a time of discoveries: an ally at work, a new crush in your social circle, that obscene altar in the woods that your grandparents’ grandparents brought to America.
Aries: Before seeking revenge, dig two graves. More if you plan on being thorough.
Taurus: Your dreams will come true this week. Unfortunately, all of your dreams are nightmares.

Cancer: The murder attempt on you will fail, but try to stay positive.
Leo: Before challenging someone to handle you at your worst, give some consideration to how unbearable you are even at your best.

Scorpio: The human heart is yielding yet complex, with hints of spiced smoke and a velvety mouthfeel.
Sagittarius: The “Great" Beast foretold by the prophecy will be just OK.
Capricorn: Your day will be filled with excitement and end with a ride in a fancy car. Ask if they’ll turn on the siren for you.
Aquarius: You’re destined to die alone, no two ways about it. Sorry, but it’s in the stars. Nothing personal, Brian.

Taurus: You’ve been going through a difficult time, but this week things will get worse.
Gemini: Not every relationship is meant to last. Especially when you're involved.

Leo: Be yourself. Run up massive credit card debt. Then be somebody else.
Virgo: You will finally get everything you deserve this year, which is great news for your enemies.
Libra: Stop stressing about your inner demons – or any demons, for that matter. The denizens of the underworld are doing okay right now, so relax! All’s well that tends hell.

Capricorn: Allowing new people into your life will make this an especially rewarding week for any sociopaths you come across.

Aries: It’s a new year full of human interactions to avoid.
Taurus: The stars are amused by your cute hopes and dreams.
Gemini: This week you will find delight in correcting a coworker's incorrect usage of your/you're in a work email. Also, you will die alone.
Cancer: That New Year's resolution about being a better person? It's time to let it go, you miserable asshole.
Leo: New year, new you. There is literally a new version of you out there hunting you down. Good luck!
Virgo: A new year is the perfect time to start over. Venture deep into the forest. Live amongst the deer.
Libra: The human body replaces 98% of its atoms every 7 years. It’s that other 2% you should be worried about.
Scorpio: You’ll stack your sandwich wrong and feel terrible about the cheese placement.
Sagittarius: Congrats on changing your New Year’s resolution 3 times already and still managing to fail at them!
Capricorn: May auld acquaintance be forgot & may they forget you as well, lest you awake one night to a gaunt figure standing at the foot of your bed, gnarled hands outstretched, their piercing, shrieking voice asking if you still have that copy of Groundhog’s Day they lent you.
Aquarius: The new year WON'T bring you peace or fulfillment but you will find a great deal on asbestos remediation.
Pisces: Try something new. No, not that. No, not that either.
Aries: Everything today will be pretty much the same as yesterday, which is frankly better than you deserve.
Taurus: Would you rather be dying inside or literally dying? What if we said you could be both?
Gemini: It's time to put all the disappointments and misery of 2019 behind you and look forward to 2020, which will have lots of new disappointments and misery in store for you.
Cancer: An attractive stranger will let you pet their dog.
Leo: You’ll finally find someone to blame for your shitty life.
Virgo: With 2019 coming to an end, keep in mind the new year is a time for new beginning and new directions. Or nude erections. The fates weren’t super clear on which.
Libra: If the holiday season bled your bank account dry, don’t fret! There are plenty of ways to make quick cash. Check out Taskrabbit. Drive for Lyft. Sell a kidney. Hell, sell several; no one said they have to be yours.
Scorpio: Good news: you're getting a bonus at work. The bad news: it's a claw hammer and a letter from your boss about "The Great Harvest."
Sagittarius: New year means new beginnings. Shed your old grudges like you shed your exoskeleton– abruptly, violently, and with no living witnesses.
Capricorn: Great news! You will find your forever home this month. (Slightly less great news: it’s a coffin.)
Aquarius: Why run away from your problems when you can drown in them instead?
Pisces: It's like the famous saying goes: “You will die on January 3rd.”
Aries: It will be an “old fashioned Christmas” for you this year, with a teenager giving birth in your garage.
Taurus: Ever the headstrong bull, your festivities will take a turn for the nasty when you get into a violent argument at your holiday work party. Take care to watch that temper and make sure any arterial bleeds are staunched immediately.
Gemini: There will be some nice presents for you under the tree this year! Sadly, the ability to become a functioning adult won’t be one of them so your life will remain a mess.
Cancer: You will be visited by three ghosts this Christmas. They're all married, so don't even ask.
Leo: The coming holidays would be an excellent time to gather your family and tell them everything they know about you is a lie.
Virgo: If Tim Allen’s “The Santa Clause” taught us anything, it’s that if you kill someone, you get their job. Anyway, it’s something to think about.
Libra: Feeling bad about your holiday binge? Keep perspective– a little splurge here and there is okay. We’re all just bags of gore in earthtone sacks, slaves to our biological imperatives to feed, fuck, and fight, until our carbon grows too frail to support its own hedonism.
Scorpio: These aren't the stars you're looking for.
Sagittarius: Make a decision for once in your life. There’s nothing more annoying than a control freak pretending they have no idea what they want to eat.
Capricorn: Your joke about how your Christmas lights are "visible from space" won't seem as funny when They arrive.
Aquarius: Regret signing up to host the extended family this holiday season? Tough tits; learning to follow through on your promises will help you grow as a person. Plus, you need fresh bodies to secure Krampus’ protection during the Yuletide purge.
Pisces: Believing you have super powers, you will briefly give up sweets.
Aries: Stop getting in your own way, get in someone else’s way instead.
Taurus: Make time for self care this week. Read a novel. Take a nap. Make a voodoo doll of your enemy.
Gemini: Consider a change of scenery. Then reconsider. Palm trees won't solve your problems​.
Cancer: Two opportunities will present themselves. If you pick one, things will go horribly wrong. If you pick the other, things will go horribly wrong but in a funny, slapstick kinda way.
Leo: The voice in your head is not your friend.
Virgo: Like a modern day Jesus, you'll cause a scene at a wedding.
Libra: The holiday season is just another reminder of how sad and lonely you really are.
Scorpio: At this very moment, somewhere in the world, a witch is casting an evil spell-for-hire on you.
Sagittarius: You remember that scene from Alien where the guy thinks he is not feeling well, but then a creature bursts out of his chest and kills everyone? That's the best way I can describe what is happening inside of you right now, only emotionally.
Capricorn: A positive attitude is like an air freshener in a septic tank.
Aquarius: Your real friends are the ones who tolerate your frequent and obvious attempts to trick them into climbing into the machine.
Pisces: You'll keep trying new Instagram filters until you briefly forget your creeping mortality.
Aries: Why bother? No really, we’re asking. Why fucking bother?
Taurus: The microchip in your brain will malfunction this week, triggering feelings of happiness and self-worth.
Gemini: As you look back on the hardships of the previous week, remember that things could be much worse. Because soon, they will be.
Cancer: You're going to discover Guy Fieri in your crawlspace while renovating the kitchen. He's going to have excuses and you shouldn't believe them.
Leo: You’re well on your way to realizing your dreams and discovering just how dumb they really are.
Virgo: A new experience will fill you with joy. Wait. No. Those are bees. A new experience will fill you with thousands & thousands of bees.
Libra: Congratulations! The universe has awarded you with 25 nap credits! These may be used at any time for one (1) free nap per credit. When you are out of credits you will die.
Scorpio: This week you will finally evolve beyond your larval stage! Remember to stock up on carbohydrates by consuming the biomatter in your gestation pod.
Sagittarius: They're going to automate your job this month, leaving you no choice but to battle robots for your CEO's amusement.
Capricorn: You decide to reclaim your time and stand firm until the moment someone asks you to do a thankless task for them.
Aquarius: Even though you've never met him, you'll become one of those people who refers to the acclaimed actor as "Bobby DeNiro.”
Pisces: Don't spend your last two Chuck E. Cheese tokens. The preacher needs them to put on your eyes.
Aries: Not even misery loves you.
Taurus: The impermanence of life will become clear to you this week when your phone dies and you can’t find the charger.
Gemini: Look, this is awkward, but the stars asked us to tell you to stop calling. They've moved on, you should move on too. Don't make things weird, alright?
Cancer: Remember how hard the ground gets this time of year. Bring a shovel AND a pick.
Leo: You'll be a big hit at the office holiday party. Wait. Sorry, I misread that. You will be used as a piñata at the office holiday party.
Virgo: You will be literally beside yourself this week when you wake up in a cloning facility.
Libra: You’ll be getting some really good news today, which will put you in a great headspace. This flood of serotonin will remind you that you haven’t felt this good since they left. They always made you feel so good. And they always smelled so nice, like lavender & sandalwood.
Scorpio: This week you will lay an egg in your sleep, and out of the egg will hatch a tiny horse with the face of a man, who you must stab through the heart with a golden scepter to prevent the end of the world.
Sagittarius: Look up at the stars tonight and know that somewhere someone is looking up at those same stars and forgetting you forever.
Capricorn: There's no easy way to say this, mainly because the Death Curse cast on you is from a language long-banished from mortal tongues.
Aquarius: You have some nice thoughts, they’re just trapped beneath a constantly-swirling layer of every medical horror story you’ve ever heard.
Pisces: You’ll find yourself in an awkward social situation at a party when no less than three guests mistake you for the person who killed their father.
Aries: Fashion comes and goes, but your ugly puberty pictures are forever.
Taurus: You will sleep like the dead this week. Exactly like the dead. Look, you’re gonna die ok. Deal with it.
Gemini: Stop wasting precious time and energy hating yourself. Let others do it for you.
Cancer: If at first you don't succeed, be more realistic next time, loser.
Leo: As you head into the holidays just remember: you've touched the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, of people. Getting two presents and a card just shows how unwanted that touch was.
Virgo: Objects in the rear view mirror are closer than they appear. You were naive to think you could outrun your past. The stars know what you did.
Libra: You’ll get plenty of ‘me time’ this week after they put you in quarantine.
Scorpio: Just another miserable day of suffocating consciousness.
Sagittarius: You’ve mastered the art of screening phone calls and never checking any sort of mail. The bill collectors can’t claim you owe them anything if they think you’re dead. You’ll also never be invited to another event again. Win-Win!
Capricorn: You’ll be hosting some unexpected visitors later this month. Plan a big meal for your new guests, as they will be residing in your lower intestine and will be consuming a good percentage of your caloric intake.
Aquarius: You always hoped that as you age, fear and ennui would disappear and life would start to make sense, and you’re finally realizing: no.
Pisces: Would you rather be replaced by a doppelgänger that did everything better than you, or one who did everything worse? Just wondering.
Aries: Cool tattoo. Design #438 really captures your uniqueness.
Taurus: The first step is admitting you have a problem. The second step is throwing a large rock at the person who said you had a problem. The third step is going back to pretending you don't have a problem.
Gemini: Much like improvisational jazz, communication with your significant other is all about the words you don’t say. And also much like improvisational jazz, it won’t matter because you are fundamentally unlikable.
Cancer: You'll answer one of the world's great mysteries this week when Bigfoot kicks your ass on national TV.
Leo: You're going to be a podcast sensation! (The genre is true crime and the subject is the events that transpire just as you begin to drift to sleep this evening).
Virgo: We apologize for our earlier horoscope that said you'd be hunted for sport inside an abandoned Home Depot. It will actually be a Lowe's.
Libra: In an effort to be more gracious you start giving thanks for each breath you take, turning your life into a prison of nothing but breathing then giving thanks.
Scorpio: Today you will devour your foes. You will consume them because this is what you excel at. Nobody can beat you so go forward and destroy that buffet.
Sagittarius: If causing your own misery were an olympic event, your face would be on a box of Wheaties.
Capricorn: A new love interest will give you butterflies. Harvest their cocoons.
Aquarius: Avoid open water. Like, forever.
Pisces: Dance like no one is watching. Except, we are. We’re all watching you fail.
Aries: Take good care of your skin. Someone is going to need it soon.
Taurus: This is a good day to take stock of your life and helplessly scream into the void.
Gemini: You have the courage to stand up for your beliefs, but the Oxford comma is not your fight.
Cancer: You will discover a corpse in the woods that has your face. Why is it smiling?
Leo: The first step to changing your identity is to choose someone to become. Make sure you don’t turn into your mother.
Virgo: Only one of you can be the True Virgo. Pick up a stick and we’ll begin.
Libra: That shit you're drowning in is yours.
Scorpio: Only the good die young, which means if you’re reading this and you’re past 40, it is your duty to become a super villain. Jump on that before all the good villainous lair property is gone, & you end up having to base your evil headquarters out of Green Bay or some shit.
Sagittarius: It will be a great day for the ever shifting reflection in your mirror as it replaces you. Your mother is so proud of it.
Capricorn: "Eat shit and die" is usually an insult rather than a foretold destiny, but hey, you always do things differently.
Aquarius: The biggest secret of your life will be revealed under hypnosis this month- your abduction and almost immediate return by aliens due to be being considered faulty.
Pisces: Don’t drown out all the critical voices in your head- one of them is almost certainly keeping you alive.
Aries: You will give blood generously this week, but it won’t be your idea.
Taurus: Today you’ll live up to your potential. Who knew you had almost none.
Gemini: Howling at the moon in torn pants doesn't make you a werewolf, what's in your heart makes you a werewolf.
Cancer: The next worldwide pandemic will be your fault. I hope you're proud.
Leo: You have a knack for self-loathing. Embrace it by spending the day online comparing your real self to the manicured facades of others.
Virgo: Just because the seasons change doesn't mean you have to. You can just keep stagnating. Like, a swamp. Where you belong.
Libra: You’re not like the others! You go against the grain, just as every Libra before you has claimed. Yes, you’re unique alright. And that’s why everyone avoids you like the plague.
Scorpio: November is shaping up to be a truly great month for rage crying.
Sagittarius: It may feel like the universe is out to get you, because it is.
Capricorn: Today you will receive an affectionate, supportive visit from someone close to you. They will come into your home unannounced and say kind platitudes in a soothing register. After they leave, it will slowly dawn on you that they never once blinked or breathed.
Aquarius: Expect a barely noticed but fatal role in the upcoming giant lizard invasion of your city this month.
Pisces: You will finally see that infamous cursed movie, but streaming it through your cursed Roku box will cancel things out.
Aries: Your skeleton will try to escape this week. You will be powerless to stop it.
Taurus: Seriously, what’s wrong with you?
Gemini: What doesn’t kill you will camp out in the hills and patiently wait.
Cancer: Don’t apologize to anyone this week, save up those sorrys for when you bring on the end of the world.
Leo: As you approach the speed of light, time stops having any meaning and an instant would feel like eternity. Which would still feel shorter than having a conversation with you.
Virgo: You didn't really mean to leave the house looking like that, did you?
Libra: You're growing older and older with each passing day, there's no denying that. But so too grow the odds that massive numbers of us will die simultaneously, rendering our relative ages irrelevant.

Sagittarius: Next week will bring the Hour of the Wolf, which…you know what? It’s probably nothing. It’s fine. You’ll be fine.
Capricorn: You will cross paths with someone you knew long ago. Neither of you will recognize each other though, so it won't be like a whole thing.

Taurus: Today is International Hate Yourself Day, and you have been selected to lead the parade.

Virgo: A bad situation gets worse this week when your family refuses to pay the ransom.
Libra: Most people live their entire lives without confronting the face of evil. This is your lucky day!
Scorpio: You will always have the ability to make people laugh because your life is a joke.
Sagittarius: Fuck dating! You don’t need anyone but yourself. You are strong, you are independent, and you deserve to do nice things for you. Date yourself, you know? Better yet, carbon date yourself. Find out just how prehistoric the demon inhabiting your fleshy shell truly is.

Scorpio: When you find the same problem arises again and again you simply have to dig deeper. Shallow graves never work on the living.

Capricorn: This Fall you’ll feel like you’re going nowhere in life. It’s good you’ve come to terms with that.
Aquarius: Don’t get cocky. Remember that one wrong move could cause you pain for a good long while. Don't take uncalculated risks. The old gods have very long memories and even longer talons, and will not hesitate to employ both to punish you for your hubris.

Cancer: Don’t let anger overwhelm you. Use it as a weapon to destroy your enemies.
Leo: It's not how many times you fall, it's how many times you get up without learning anything from your constant failures.

Leo: You will meet the love of your life at a restaurant (it’s a burrito).

Scorpio: You'll blank out mid-sentence when some teens throw taco wrappers on your future grave site.
Sagittarius: Remember that you can’t judge a book by its cover, but if you own a tanning rack and a vendetta against the legal system that wronged you, you CAN cover a book with a judge.
Capricorn: If gremlins aren't real then what's reading this over your shoulder?

Libra: Good news! The doctors will figure out the meaning behind the hieroglyphics that appeared on your back.
